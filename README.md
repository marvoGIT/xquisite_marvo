# xquisite

Android app for the project called scienceFuture

main function af xquisite:</br>
  * to let users see last 2 minutes of a story</br>
  * and then record 5 more minutes to a "semi-linear" story</br>
  
semi-linear story:</br>
  * the story has one starting point</br>
  * and initially one end point</br>
  * each time new video is added, story's endpoint is changed to the last recorded video.</br>
  * ideally the story should be linear but in practice many users will be able to record new videos simultaniously</br>
  * so the story will have branches</br>
  * the idea is to let administrators tag the most intresting branch to be the endpoint</br>
